# Sec-SVM

This is a repository that contains implementations of some algorithms for SVM training. There are two types of implementations: clear implementations, using Python 3 with just NumPy library, and secure implementations using MPC protocols for training and implemented in the [Multi-Protocol SPDZ](https://github.com/data61/MP-SPDZ) framework.

## Implemented algorithms:
- SMO algorithm.
- Simplified SMO algorithm.
- Gradient Descent SVM optimization.
- Least squares optimization with Gradient Descent and Gauss-Seidel methods.
